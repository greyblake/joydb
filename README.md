## Ideas

### Sync strategies

- None (manual)
- On every `write` operation
- In parallel thread (every N secods)

### Format adapters

- Single JSON file
- Multiple JSON files (database is a directory, every single JSON file represents a relation)
- Multiple CSV files (database is directory, every single CSV file represents a relation)
